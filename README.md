# Regression Modelling to analyze house sales.

This project is used by the real estate agency to help them better serve homeowners buy and sell homes.


#Objectives

You will be able to:

*Perform a train-test split

*Prepare training and testing data for modeling

*Compare training and testing errors to determine if model is over or underfitting

After loading the data in our DataFrame we go on to do our data preparation on it so as to optimize on our modelling
some of the EDA practices we do take into consideration include;
        1.Detecting missing values
        2.Identifying duplicated values
        3.Dealing with outliers
        4.Normalizing our data
        5.Check on the distribution of our dataset
  
  
Moving on to data Regression Analysis we will;
     - Checking the attainment of our regression assumptions
     - Encoding data and scaling our dataset
     - Dealing with overfitting and underfitting
     - Identifying the validation strategy to use to check that our model works well on unseen data
     - Knowing the loss function to use
     - the threshold of performance to consider as successful
